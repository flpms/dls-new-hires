# Dell Design Language Application Test

## What are you creating?   
You are developing a simple job application. The candidates should be able to navigate to the Job Apply tab, click the show form button and send their data to the company. The application you will work on already has a tab navigation system. Your job is to complete this application by adding a button at the "Career" tab to trigger a modal containing a contact form with "Name", "Email" and "Phone number" inputs, and a "Submit" button. 

## How the user should use your application?    
1 - Navigate to the "Career" tab;    
2 - Click on the "Apply Now" button;    
3 - Fill the inputs with their user data;   
4 - Click "Submit" button.  

## Instructions to follow   
- Download or clone this repository;    
- Create your own private repository on GitHub and configure the application to point to your new repository;   
- Choose your preferred code editor and start making your changes;  
- Commit and push your changes as you like; 
- When you are finished, add [@flpms](https://github.com/flpms) and [@alequiscaruso](https://github.com/alequiscaruso) users as colaborators to your recently created private repository on GitHub; 
- Finally, deploy to Heroku or any available server.    

Good luck and have fun!
